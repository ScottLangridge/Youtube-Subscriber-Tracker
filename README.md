# Pewdiepie vs T-Series Tracker
A web scraper which periodically looks at an online tracker to find the sub count of Pewdiepie and T-Series and logs them or sends a push notification depending on which script you're running. I'm not especially invested in who has the most subscribers, but it gave me a chance to play with web-scraping and sending notifications. Both of which I had never done before.
